## What is the Daytona Enterprise Demo?
The Daytona Enterprise Demo is a resource limited, single-node deployment of Daytona's enterprise offering.
This allows you to experience the capabilities of Daytona Enterprise, demonstrating how it can streamline Development Environment Management (DEM) within your organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> __The information in this repository does not apply to the Daytona open source project.__  Please refer to [`daytonaio/daytona`](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona) for information on setting up the Daytona open source project.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
* An x86_64 Linux host operating system with minimum specs:
    * 4-core CPU
    * 16GB RAM
    * 250GB disk
* Accessible TCP ports 80, 443, and 30000
* A registered domain with the following DNS records:
    * `<domain> IN A host.ip`
    * `*.<domain> IN A host.ip`
* An OAuth application with a supported identity provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) configured with the following values:
    * __Homepage URL:__ `https://<domain>`
    * __Authorization callback URL:__ `https://id.<domain>`

> [!NOTE]
> The deployment script has been officially tested on:
> * Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 23.04
> * Debian 12
> * Fedora 40
>
> If you need access to the Kubernetes cluster, ensure TCP port 6443 is open.

> [!TIP]
> For information on setting up an OAuth application, visit the corresponding documentation for your provider:
> * [GitHub OAuth documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
> * [GitLab OAuth documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html)
> * [Bitbucket OAuth documentation](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud/)

### Guided Deployment
You can deploy Daytona Enterprise Demo using the guided method.
This method will prompt you for all the information required to set up Daytona Enterprise Demo on your host machine, subsequently deploying the components required.

1. Clone this repository to the host machine and run the setup script:
	```console
    git clone https://github.com/daytonaio/enterprise-demo
    cd enterprise-demo
    ./setup.sh
    ```
2. When prompted, enter the following information:
    1. __App hostname (FQDN):__ The registered domain (`<domain>`)
    2. __Identity provider (IdP):__ Your chosen identity provider
    3. __IdP Client ID:__ The client ID associated with your OAuth application
    4. __IdP Client Secret:__ The client secret associated with your OAuth application
3. Enter any additional information prompted for based on your selection of identity provider.
4. Follow the instructions output by the script to configure required DNS records.

### Using Environment Variables
You can use environment variables to configure the deployment script at run time.
This allows you to skip the prompts in the [Guided deployment](#guided-deployment) procedure.

1. Clone this repository to the host machine:
	```console
    git clone https://github.com/daytonaio/enterprise-demo
    cd enterprise-demo
    ```
2. Set the appropriate environment variables for your identity provider in your shell, with reference to the [Environment Variable Reference](#environment-variable-reference) table.
3. Run `./setup.sh` with the environment variables set to start the deployment.

    __Example:__

    ```console
    URL="daytona.example.com" IDP="github" IDP_ID="changeme" IDP_SECRET="changeme" ./setup.sh
    ```
4. Follow the instructions output by the script to configure required DNS records.

### Updating
You can update an existing deployment of Daytona Enterprise Demo.

1. In your clone of this repository, execute the following to incorporate the latest updates:
    ```
    git pull origin
    ```
2. Follow either the [Guided Deployment](#guided-deployment) or [Using Environment Variables](#using-environment-variables) procedure using the same variables.

### Removing/Uninstalling
You can remove a deployed version of Daytona Enterprise Demo from the host machine.
This procedure allows you to redeploy the demo from scratch using the [Guided Deployment](#guided-deployment) or [Using Environment Variables](#using-environment-variables) procedure. It's also useful to reset your host machine to it's previous state before deployment.

* In your clone of this repository, run:
    ```console
    ./setup.sh --remove
    ```
